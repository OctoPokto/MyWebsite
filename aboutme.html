          <h1>Anders Findal Jørgensen</h1>

          <p>
            I am a 27-year-old game designer from Norway. I like to make cool art and mess with technology. I am looking
            for work as
            a game designer or something fittingly adjacent. Currently, I am working on a prototype about growing
            plants. You can
            see some of that on the projects page. The goal is to polish my coding skills while making something cool.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I have always been fascinated by games. It was an escape from daily life at a young age. But it wasn't
            before entering
            high school that I realised I could actually make them too. Since that realisation, I couldn't shake the
            thought that
            this was the only thing I wanted to do for a living.
          </p>

            games and sell

            where Bibliogames comes in and gives kids and adults alike the opportunity to see games as more than
            just Fortnite and Minecraft. There is beauty and knowledge in games.

            This website is purely HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. So my knowledge about how to make websites is limited to

          <h2>Cooking</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoy cooking. Due to the limitations of small apartments in Oslo, I don't have an oven, to my
            ever burning frustration.
            So I mostly cook things that fit in a pot or frying pan. A lot of Asian food is primarily prepared in a pan
            or
            pot, so my repertoire is heavily weighted towards that.
          </p>
          <h2>Custom keyboards</h2>
          <p>
            2020 was a really boring year so I got into making and collecting custom keybards.
            On my free time I help the keyboard designers <a href="https://protozoa.studio/collections">Protozoa
              Studio</a> with questions on their discord.
            You can find some pictures on my twitter (Press the twitter icon at the top of this website).
          </p>
          <h2>Building computers</h2>
          <p>
            I got into building my, and my friend's computers after my dad and I built one in my early teens.
            Since then, whenever I get the chance, I really get into finding the parts and making them look as good as I
            can.
          </p>
          <h2>Space and Plants</h2>
          <p>
            Space has always fascinated me, while plants are a newer interest.
            I like learning facts about these things in a very casual and unhurried manner.
            I read many sci-fi books in my free time, and I'm making a game about growing plants.
