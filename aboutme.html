          <p>
            I am a <ins id="currentAge"></ins>-year-old game designer from
            Norway. I have worked on some cool projects like Mørkredd,
            Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley and Fruitbus. I have the most
            experience with being a tester and QA specialist. I am looking to
            pivot into a design position, and I'm actively looking for such an
            opportunity.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I get praise for my diligence in any given task and take pride in
            that. I like to join game jams and test my design skills. I dabble
            in programming, art and sound design. Designing a game is about
            creating a cohesive whole so I try to understand how to make a
            mechanic, visual style or leitmotif when taking ideas to others.

          <h2>Cooking</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoy cooking. Due to the limitations of small apartments in
            Oslo, I dont have an oven, to my ever burning frustration. So I
            mostly cook things that fit in a pot or frying pan. A lot of Asian
            food is primarily prepared in a pan or pot, so my repertoire is
            heavily weighted towards that.

          <h2>Custom keyboards</h2>
          <p>
            2020 was a really boring year so I got into making and collecting
            custom keybards. On my free time I help the keyboard designers
            <a href="https://protozoa.studio/collections">Protozoa Studio</a>
            with questions on their discord. You can find some pictures on my
            twitter (Press the twitter icon at the top of this website).
          </p>
          <h2>Building computers</h2>
          <p>
            I got into building my, and my friends computers after my dad and
            I built one in my early teens. Since then, whenever I get the
            chance, I really get into finding the parts and making them look
            as good as I can.
          </p>
          <h2>Space and Plants</h2>
          <p>
            Space has always fascinated me, while plants are a newer interest.
            I like learning facts about these things in a very casual and
            unhurried manner. I read many sci-fi books in my free time, and Im
            making a game about growing plants.
